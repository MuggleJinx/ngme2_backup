# done
* matern model
* non-stationary matern
* non-stationery nig noise (e.g. mu)

# to-do

* (To be done jointly): homepage, vignette + documentation

* non-gaussian measurement noise
* replicates of the process (in the f function)
* handle temporal dependence 
* random effects
* parallel chains 
* hessian from all other chains
* convergence checks
* multivariate matern model
* multivariate measurement noise
* prior for the parameters
* confidence intervals for the parameters
* sharing parameters between different models
* rational approximation
* write a book
